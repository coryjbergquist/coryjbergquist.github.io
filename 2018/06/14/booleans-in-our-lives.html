<h3>
Life would be easier if things were just black and white. With Booleans, they are!
</h3>

<p>You might find comfort in certain elements of life being black and white. You are either alive, or dead. You can either smell, breathe, see, feel, walk, talk, or do none of those things. But we all know that nothing is ever that simple. You might be able to see, but only just barely. Maybe you’re considered legally blind, but you can still make out fuzzy shapes. Maybe you have a terrible sense of smell, and according to everyone you know, you can’t smell anything, but technically, you can smell some of the most smelly smells there are!</p>

<p>With all this craziness, and so much grey area in our world, wouldn’t it be nice if you could just make some things either right or wrong? Well say no more! Enter the boolean! These bad boys will slice and dice all your questions into one of two big chunks. You’re either right, or your wrong. You’re either alive, or your dead. If you need something to tell you exactly where you stand, a boolean can take your question (a.k.a. your code) and pump out a steady answer that can affect the rest of your life (a.k.a. the rest of your program). Thanks booleans!</p>
