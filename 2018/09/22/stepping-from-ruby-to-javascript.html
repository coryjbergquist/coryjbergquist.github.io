<h3> Have one coding language under your belt? On to the next! </h3>

<p>I was happy to see that my knowledge of Ruby helped me understand the basics of JavaScript very quickly. I was seeing similar object types, the ability to assign variables, define functions (similar to Ruby’s methods), and structure code in a familiar way.</p>

<h3> Data types in JavaScript: </h3>

<p>JavaScript has seven different data types, which are as follows: numbers, strings, booleans, symbols, objects, null, and undefined. Numbers and strings are similar to what you’d see in Ruby. A number is pretty much what you’d expect (1,2,3 etc.), however, numbers in JavaScript automatically include integers, decimals, floats etc. instead of having to specify what type of number you need. And Strings are pretty straight forward, text that you find inbetween quotes (either “ “, ‘ ‘, or  ). Be sure to use the backticks if you want to use interpolation (ie: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hello, ${name})</code>.</p>

<p>Booleans are pretty straight forward and can only be equal to either “true” or “false”, and will mostly be used for conditional statements, for example:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
let x = 2

function test() {
    if(x === 2) {
        x++
    }
}

test()

x

=&gt; 3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above code, we’re assigning the variable “x” to the number “2”, then creating a function that contains an if statement checking if “x” is equal to “2”, if it is, then the block of code that follows the if statement will excecute. <code class="highlighter-rouge">x++</code> is similar to x += 1 which will add one to whatever “x” is.  We then call the “test” function, followed by calling “x” which will show us the new value for “x”.</p>

<p>Objects in JavaScript are where things get a bit different from Ruby. Objects are a collection of keys and values (like a Ruby hash) that are between curly brackets “{ }”. JavaScript objects are still very powerful because they can hold any type of data.</p>

<p>Null is also different in JavaScript. Null is used when we intentionally want to leave the value of an object blank. Undefined means a value has not been assigned yet. And symbols can create unique values for identifying object properties.</p>

<p>I’m still learning a lot about JavaScript, and I’m excited to get a deeper understand of all that JavaScript has to offer!</p>
