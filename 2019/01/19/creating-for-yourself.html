<h3>Keep Your Personal Projects Going!</h3>

<p>Before I follow up on my previous article about making React Routes, I’m going to take a quick sidestep and talk about building for the sake of your own enjoyment.</p>

<p>If you have willingly spent more than five minutes teaching yourself some sort of coding language, you probably have a sincere passion for creating with code. As a new developer, it’s easy to get swept up into trying to find a job, making sure you have the skills to add value to a company and making sure that you present yourself in a professional manner. But don’t forget to take a step back and code for yourself every now and then.</p>

  <p><em>Like this idea swamped developer in the picture above, there’s probably so many ideas floating around in your head, pick one and run with it, even if it seems silly!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="a-silly-idea-might-be-just-what-you-need-to-keep-pushing-yourself-as-a-developer">A silly idea might be just what you need to keep pushing yourself as a developer.</h4>

<p>Even if it’s just laying out a basic <code class="highlighter-rouge">NOTES</code> file in your directory that outlines an idea that you think might be fun or cool. This can be a huge breath of fresh air and renew your drive to continue learning throughout your career in code.</p>

<p>For me, I decided it would be fun to create a web application that randomly generated a user’s superhero for the day. Similar to how people read their daily horoscopes, this would be a light hearted “give yourself this superhero power boost to help your through the day” type of app.</p>

<h3 id="developing-your-own-work-helps-you-dig-deeper-into-any-and-all-problems">Developing your own work helps you dig deeper into any and all problems.</h3>

<p>When I first began writing code for this project, I quickly realized that in my previous applications I may have gone too quickly into using Redux without fully appreciating it. I love working with React and it was great to fully work out my idea until I reached a point where it really made sense to move all of my <code class="highlighter-rouge">state</code> into one place with the Redux <code class="highlighter-rouge">store</code>.</p>

<p>The act alone of creating a brand new application is great practice for keeping your knowledge fresh. I definitely had to go back and look up a few JavaScript best practices.</p>

<h3 id="something-i-can-always-come-back-to">Something I can always come back to.</h3>

<p>Even if I am unable to finish this application right away, it’s great to know that I have something fun that I can open up and make a few git commits to whenever I’m up for a challenge.</p>

<p>After about a year of pushing myself to the max and learning everything I possibly can, the simple task of typing <code class="highlighter-rouge">npx create-react-app random-superhero</code> and starting to build something just for fun has really given me a jumpstart in my motivation to keep learning, and keep the curiousity alive.</p>

<h3 id="keep-coding-fun">Keep coding fun!</h3>
