<h3> There's no kind of learning like building from scratch! </h3>

<p>I have to admit, I stumbled quite a bit while learning React and Redux. Between learning a new style of coding and trying to keep track of exactly where the line was between JavaScript, React and Redux, there was a lot to take it. Throughout the entire progress I kept to one simple idea that kept me going: any progress is better than no progress. As long as I could dedicate some of my day to learning and completing a few lessons, then I could be confident that I was still moving forward.</p>

<p>This project is made for creating small sound clips and storing them for later. Sort of like an idea notebook meant specifically for musicians, singers, or anyone who uses sounds to create something. A user can make a sound name, and description, which will be stored on a rails API. A user can also come back to that sound and make comments or delete the sound.</p>

<p>While building this application, I was fresh off of several lessons about React and Redux, so I was happily excited to really get a deeper understanding of how to get the front end working just how I wanted. It took me a bit of extra reading, but I was able to get a smooth flow of creating sounds, descriptions and comments, updating my Redux store through actions and adding a root Reducer to hold any extra reducers I might create later.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I ran into was learning how to hook up my front end with my rails API. It took several articles and videos for me to realize that I was making things much too complicated and that my rails back end only had to be a host for my database and really nothing more. Thanks especially to my Flatiron community that came through in Slack and pointed me in the direction of a couple great videos and talked me through how I needed to get my rails API to function. Several more videos and articles later I was able to feel pretty comfortable sending different types of requests using fetch() in my actions.</p>

<p>There’s really no better way to learn than by building your own applications and I can’t wait to get started on the next one!</p>
