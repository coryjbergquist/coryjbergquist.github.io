<h3> The path to learning Sinatra sure has a lot of routes you can take! </h3>

<p>After gaining a lot of confidence in my Ruby skills, dipping my feet into using HTML and CSS, and feeling pretty darn comfortable with ActiveRecord, I finally felt like I was able to put everything together with Sinatra. I finally felt like I could build something real.</p>

<p>Up until this point I felt as though I was only building small parts of an application, maybe a database here, or a static HTML web page over there. But nothing that fully worked together to form a full working application that you could see in a browser and interact with. Well that time has ended! Understanding how Sinatra works has given me new inspiration while thinking about a project as a whole. I feel like I have the ability to create more intelligently by keeping in mind how each line of code I write will affect the other parts of my program, perhaps lines that I haven’t even written yet. It’s a very liberating feeling, being able to write code with a solid grasp on exactly how that code will function and how it will look in a browser.</p>

<p>My Sinatra Sound Organizer is meant to be a program that allows users to keep track of small sounds or song ideas that they may want to revisit at a later time. Maybe they heard a really cool sounding percussive element and were able to record it, and they just want to make sure they can come back to it later. Or maybe they came up with a great chord progression for a song and don’t want to forget it. This program will allow people to create a user, and then save their sound clips (with name, description and file). Users can view all of their sounds on their home page, or see each individual sound and description, as well as edit, delete, and add new sounds.</p>

<p>Starting on this particular project was actually fairly easy. After familiarizing myself with a few basic Sinatra layouts, I was able to create the framework of my application (making sure to include a README, gem file, environment etc.) and begin writing the code for my MVC structure. We have had a lot of practice building correct routes for creating objects, saving them in the database, and returning them back to the view page, which made making my own routes a breeze.</p>

<p>I ran into a little bit of a hiccup when I had a bit of an overload of information on my index view page. My idea was to have the main index page contain either the login/sign up forms or the users main list of sounds, depending on if the current user was logged in or not. So as soon as you navigated to the main page you could potentially immediately see the sounds that you have uploaded. However, this proved to be a little messy looking, and I didn’t want to start overloading my view pages when it wasn’t really necessary. So I settled on creating a separate login/sign up page, and inside my controller route for “/” I used my “is_logged_in?” helper method to either redirect the user to their sounds page, or directly render the login/sign up page. This way, my views pages stayed a bit more clean, and I still had the function of being able to see my sounds simply by going to the root url (as long as I was already logged in).</p>

<p>Another issue I had was finding out the correct search path for finding uploaded files. I could see that my browser was sending me a file name and a temp file, but I wasn’t aware how to actually get the newly uploaded file onto my sound’s view page. I found that I needed to create the file in the “public” directory so that it could be found by name when it was called in my views page. I was happy to find that I was able to submit both the file and text in my form by using enctype=”multipart/form-data”.</p>

<p>I spent just a bit of time adding bootstrap to my application to clean up the view pages a little (I plan on spending more time getting the views to look better), but it was nice to focus mostly on creating a functional web application, and I’m very happy with the result.</p>
